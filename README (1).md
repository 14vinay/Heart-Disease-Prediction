# Heart diseases Prediction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to bulid a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators.


## Problem Statement
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial to prevent severe health outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and prone to human error, limting their effectiveness in early-stage detection.
## Objective

To develop a binary classification model that can predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease (yes or no) using key medical features.
## Approach
1. Data Preprocessing.
2. Model training.
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   * Applying Logistic Regression to training model.
3. Model Evaluation.
   * Evaluate the model using F1-Score.
## Data set
1.  Age
2.  Sex [1 - male, 0 - female]
3.  CP - chest pain type [4 values]
4.  trestbps - resting blood pressure
5.  Chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.  fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl [1 - true, 0 - false]
7.  restecg - resting electrocardiographic results [values 0,1,2]
8.  thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9.  exang - exercise induced angina [1 - yes, 0 - no]
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels [0-3] colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
